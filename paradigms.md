# Paradigms to tackle complexity

Programming paradigms are ways to think about problems and express them in code. Here are some of them:

- **Procedural/imperative**: code is a series of steps in sequence
- **Object-oriented**: code in objects that have in-memory state, coupled with behavior
- **Functional**: code is a series of functions that transform data
- **Declarative**: code is a description of the desired state, not the steps to reach it
- **Aspect-oriented**: code is a series of cross-cutting concerns that are applied to other code

## Refactor to simplify

Try a simple assignment to reduce duplication, and achieve semantic distance by removing complexity.
