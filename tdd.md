# TDD in practice

This assignment deals with statistics computed from batches of data from an IoT weight-sensor.

    B --> C[Passing test]
    C --> D[Refactor]
    D --> A
```

## Specification as tests

This assignment has the specification in tests. Write minimal code to pass those tests.
Implement the data structure and input validation - based on the asserts.

You could encounter many requests for extending the functionality in future - additional data-sources, statistics to be computed, and actions to be taken.

Tip: Do not over-engineer. Write minimal code _just enough_ to pass the tests.

Pick the assignment in your language. Don't forget to read the README.md.
